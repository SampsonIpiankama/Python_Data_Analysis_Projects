# Python Data Analysis Projects
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 

In this repository, you'll find projects showcasing my skills and experience in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. In general, I aim to show how I would clean, analyze and interpret data.
