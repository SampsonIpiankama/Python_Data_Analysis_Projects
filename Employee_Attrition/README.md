# Introduction and Problem statement

Attrition in human resources refers to the departure of staff for any reason from a company over time. The impact of attrition on a company can be detrimental to both the bottom line and morale. It leads to the reduction of talent in the workforce. Replacing employees can be expensive too as the company has to go through the hiring processes, paperwork, and new hire training. Other costs of attrition include decreased productivity and profit to the company. To decrease attrition, managers must understand the causes of customer and employee turnover, the costs associated with attrition, and finally, institute measures to reduce attrition rates.

The dataset used in the code pattern is supplied by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/home) and contains HR analytics data of employees that stay and leave. The types of data include metrics such as education level, job satisfaction, and commute distance.

## Summary and Recommendations
1.    To be able to truly predict which variable influences attrition, various predictive models which are based on artificial neural networks, DT, Bayesian method, logistic regression, SVM, etc., should be employed.
2.    With this analysis (to a degree), the organization can choose the employees with the utmost chances of leaving the organization and then assign them confined incentives
